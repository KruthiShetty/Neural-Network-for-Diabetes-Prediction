- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  Analyzed the distribution of target classes and visualized sample data to identify patterns and inform preprocessing strategies.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and standardized numerical features.

- **Data Splitting**  
  Divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to enable effective model training and evaluation.

- **Model Architecture**  
  Constructed a deep feedforward neural network using TensorFlow and Keras. Configured input, hidden, and output layers with appropriate activation functions.
